This excerise was to review the provided index.html and re-structure the HTML code organizing it and adding/replacing
some of the syntax with semantic elements for **accessibility**.

The file structure is as follows:

1.  Directory "Assets" contains the webpage picture of what it should look like.
2.  Directory "Develop" contains both the "assets" directory and index.html to restructure.

The updated index.html file contains the following structure:

1.  Header
2.  Navigation
